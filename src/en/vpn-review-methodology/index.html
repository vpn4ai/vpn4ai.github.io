<h2>How we review VPN services</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Long-term stability:</strong> we focus on consistency over time, not a single short test.</li>
  <li><strong>Node coverage & redundancy:</strong> more options matter when some nodes perform poorly.</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol & compatibility:</strong> mature protocols and solid clients reduce friction.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy policy & transparency:</strong> clear logging policy and security practices.</li>
  <li><strong>User experience:</strong> onboarding, apps, kill switch, and recovery behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost over time:</strong> long-term pricing and plan value.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Network conditions vary by region and can change over time. No service can guarantee 100% availability in all conditions.
